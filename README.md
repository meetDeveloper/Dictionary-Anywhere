# Dictionary Anywhere
The **Dictionary Anywhere** extension helps you stay focused on what you are reading by eliminating the need to search for the meaning of words. 
Double-click any word to view its definition in a small pop-up bubble. 
Now you never have to leave what you are reading to search for the meaning of the words you don't yet know.

In addition to English, you can also view definitions for Spanish, German, and French.
